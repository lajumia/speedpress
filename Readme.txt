Removing unused CSS in a WordPress website helps improve performance by reducing file size and load times. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Identify Unused CSS
Use tools to identify unused CSS on your site:
- Google PageSpeed Insights: Provides a list of unused CSS with potential savings.
- Lighthouse (in Chrome DevTools): Run a performance audit to see unused styles.
- Coverage Tab (Chrome DevTools): Check loaded and unused CSS directly during page load.

2. Use WordPress Plugins
Some plugins can automatically remove or optimize unused CSS:
- Asset CleanUp: Allows you to unload unused CSS on specific pages.
- WP Rocket: Has a "Remove Unused CSS" feature in its performance settings.
- Perfmatters: Helps disable unnecessary CSS files for faster loading.
- Autoptimize: Combines, minifies, and eliminates unused CSS.

3. Manually Remove Unused CSS
For a more controlled approach, you can manually clean unused CSS:
1. Locate Unused CSS using tools (PageSpeed, Lighthouse).
2. Edit Your Themeâ€™s CSS:
   - Access your WordPress theme files via the dashboard or FTP.
   - Remove unnecessary styles from `style.css` or other CSS files.
3. Custom CSS Rules: Use child themes or the Customizer to override or remove unused styles.



 4. Dequeue Unnecessary Styles
WordPress themes and plugins often enqueue unnecessary styles. Use this code in your themeâ€™s `functions.php` to dequeue unused styles:

```php
function remove_unused_styles() {
    wp_dequeue_style('plugin-or-theme-style-handle'); // Replace with the handle
    wp_deregister_style('plugin-or-theme-style-handle');
}
add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'remove_unused_styles');
```



 5. Lazy Load and Conditional Loading
- Use conditional loading to only include CSS on pages where needed.
- For example, load a contact formâ€™s styles only on the contact page.



 6. Inline Critical CSS
Extract and inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content using tools like:
- Critical Path CSS Generator
- Plugins like WP Rocket or Autoptimize.



 7. Avoid Unnecessary Plugins and Themes
Choose lightweight themes and plugins that are optimized for performance and don't load excessive styles.



 8. Regular Maintenance
As you add new plugins or update themes, unused CSS can creep back in. Periodically review your siteâ€™s performance and clean up unnecessary styles.



By following these steps, you can minimize CSS bloat, improve page load speed, and boost user experience! ðŸš€
